<H1>Volumetric Dilution Calculator - Instructions</h1>
<p>
This online tool will perform the calculations involved in a simple volumetric dilution 
analysis either for a wastewater discharge (including spills), or for calculation of the area of impact
of a marina.  The tool is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the potential size of a closure 
area needed to dilute a quantity of fecal coliform bacteria down to the level of a criterion that
you provide.  This criterion is typically the applicable National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) 
geometric mean for the current classification of the waters.
</p>
<p>There are other more precise methods to estimate closure areas.  These include water quality models, 
dye and drogue studies.  If use of a more precise method is an option,it should be employed instead of 
the dilution analysis.  However, if you are dealing with an emergency condition such as a spill and an
estimate is needed of the area to close, this dilution analysis can be a valuable tool.  THIS ONLINE 
TOOL IS INTENDED ONLY FOR TRAINING PURPOSES.  CONSULT WITH THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR 
THE APPROPRIATE TOOL(S) TO USE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES.
</p>
<p>
The program will start by asking if you want to do the calculations for a discharge or a marina.  You 
will also need to designate if you want to enter your data and see results in Standard U.S. units or 
Metric units.  It also prompts for the Latitude and Longitude (in decimal degrees) of the discharge 
or marina location.  Once you have made these entries, it will prompt you for the additional information
needed and calculate the closure area dimensions.  For the discharge analysis, it will prompt you for the
discharge flow rate and the fecal coliform (FC) concentration (FC/100 mL).  Use the blue button (Click 
for options to use) to view and select a fecal coliform concentration value to use in the calculations.
</p>
<p>
For the marina buffer analysis, it will prompt you for the number of slips in the marina.  Default values
are provided for the other factors such as persons per boat and slip occupancy.  If you have different 
numbers for these entries that are supported by data, you can replace the default values with your
numbers.  Use the "Map the Closure" button to see the closure area mapped, based on the coordinates you 
provided at the beginning.  To start the process over, press the "Reset" button at the bottom.
